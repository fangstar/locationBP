I took the project (http://code.google.com/p/android-protips-location/) done by Reto Meier,
 read Readme_orig.txt, and coarsely hacked out all the Google Places API code. Now all the
 app does is update the Latitude and Longitude location. 
   I was hoping to make some kind of template of where one can just add some hooks to connect
to their own DB but too lazy to finish it. So therefore you just get some real ugly code uploaded
but hopefully one can figure it out easier than trying to figure out the "original" project.
  If enough requests I will clean it up and write documentation but would rather work on my own
app than do documentation.

------- Snippet from original project Readme (Readme_orig.txt)

It is an open-source reference implementation of a location-based app that 
incorporates several tips, tricks, best practices, and cheats for creating 
high quality apps.

Particular attention has been paid to reducing the time between opening an app
and seeing an up-to-date list of nearby venues and providing a reasonable level
of offline support.

The code implements all of the location best-practices for reducing latency and
battery consumption as detailed in my Google I/O 2011 session,
